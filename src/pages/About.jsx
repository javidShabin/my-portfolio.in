          Hi, I'm Javid shabin, a self-taught MERN stack developer with a
          background in sociology. Despite graduating in sociology, my true
          passion lies in coding and web development. I discovered my love for
          building applications and solving technical challenges, which led me
          to pursue a career in this field. <br />
          I specialize in MongoDB, Express,
          React, and Node.js, and I've been enhancing my skills through
          self-learning and studying at Entri. I enjoy developing responsive,
          user-friendly web applications and continuously exploring new
          technologies to stay ahead in the tech world. <br />
          When I'm not coding,
          you'll find me enjoying music, watching movies, or diving into the
          latest tech trends. My journey into web development has been exciting,
          and I'm always eager to collaborate on new projects and grow as a
          developer.
